## About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Aayan, currently pursuing my Master's in Earth Sciences at IISER Kolkata. As a data analyst, I'm passionate about exploring the intersection between data science and our planet's most critical systems. 

My focus includes exploring everything from the long-term trends in global warming to the computational analysis of seismic activity. This passion within me with a multidisciplinary mindset keeps me how data can be utilized for the ends of disaster risk and hazard management to assist with the realization of a more resilient and sustainable future. ðŸŒ¿ 

When I'm not delving into datasets, I channel my time and creativity through photography ðŸ“¸ and music, playing both piano and drums. ðŸŽµ



This repository showcases my skills, shares projects, and tracks my progress in data analytics, especially related to earthquake hazard and climate change.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list my analysis projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve real-world cases.

### Climate & Catastrophe: A Data-Driven Analysis of Rising Temperatures, Natural Disasters, and their Economic Toll
**Code:** [`Exploratory_data_analysis_of_temperature_and_natural_disasters.ipynb`](https://github.com/Pianomello/Climate_Impact/blob/main/Exploratory_data_analysis_of_temperature_and_natural_disasters.ipynb)

**Goal:** This project's main objective is to present compelling, fact-based proof of the connection between climate changeâ€”more especially, anomalies in global temperaturesâ€”and the rise in the frequency of natural disasters. It also seeks to examine the financial effects of these calamities while taking global economic expansion into consideration.

**Description:** The relationship between anomalies in global temperatures, the frequency of different natural disasters, and the resulting economic damages is examined in this exploratory data analysis (EDA). Three major datasets are used in the project: global temperatures, the number of natural disaster events, and the economic damage caused by natural disasters. Global GDP data is also used for normalization.

The analysis includes:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing include reshaping dataframes for analysis, handling missing values, and converting data types.

2. Temperature Anomaly Calculation: To identify warming trends, temperature anomalies are calculated from a baseline (1951â€“1980 average).

3. Classifying and displaying the frequency of various natural disaster types over time is known as disaster occurrence analysis.

4. Evaluating the total and normalized (as a percentage of GDP) financial losses brought on by natural disasters is known as economic damage analysis.

5. Correlation Analysis: To measure the relationship between temperature anomalies, disaster events (both general and climate-related), and economic damages, Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are calculated.

6. Statistical Testing: Determining the statistical significance of observed correlations by utilizing the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test and analyzing p-values.

7. Limitations Discussion: Taking into account elements such as reporting bias.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, correlation matrices, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** In conclusion, the statistics overwhelmingly prove that a hotter world is experiencing more consistent pounding by nature disasters, which is having a consistent and measurable, even if complicated, impact upon the global economy.





### Automated Amazon Price Tracker & Alert System
