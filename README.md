## About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Aayan, currently pursuing my Master's in Earth Sciences at IISER Kolkata. As a data analyst, I'm passionate about exploring the intersection between data science and our planet's most critical systems. 

My focus includes exploring everything from the long-term trends in global warming to the computational analysis of seismic activity. This passion within me with a multidisciplinary mindset keeps me how data can be utilized for the ends of disaster risk and hazard management to assist with the realization of a more resilient and sustainable future. ðŸŒ¿ 

When I'm not delving into datasets, I channel my time and creativity through photography ðŸ“¸ and music, playing both piano and drums. ðŸŽµ



This repository showcases my skills, shares projects, and tracks my progress in data analytics, especially related to earthquake hazard and climate change.
